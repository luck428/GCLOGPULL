#GCLOGPULL#

GCLOGPULL pulls the **complete** list of logs from any geocache and stores them as CSV files on your PC.

Whereas other tools only download a limited number of logs or turned disfunctional through geocaching.com changes in their webpage
this little tool uses the Geocaching WEB API

It is mainly aimed at cache owners who want to keep statistics of their own caches or be able to quickly check who has visited their caches already
The only other tool providing a similar solution is GSAK. This is the free alternative.


This little tool is ready to use for windows, the windows executable can be downloaded here.
